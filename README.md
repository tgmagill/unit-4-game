# Gem Collector Game

Welcome to my Gem Collector Game where I will challenge you to try and match the random number without going over!

I have used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create this simple game to reflect my advancing skillset in leveraging these languages.

## Instructions

1. The page will display a random number in the salmon colored box.
1. Click on one of the 4 gems and your score will increase.
1. Continue clicking different gems to try and match your score to the random number.
1. You will not be able to see the number that is connected with the gems so remember what you click!
1. If you go over then you will lose that game.
1. If your score matches the number you win!  Congrats!
1. #### Good luck!
